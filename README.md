The route I decided to go for the website’s design was to be a sleek, dark minimalistic theme with an emphasis on clarity, professionalism, and a smooth user experience.
Dark Minimalistic Theme: Uses a dark background with contrasting white text for readability and a modern look.
Flexbox Layout: Ensures a clean, structured presentation of content, making navigation intuitive.
Smooth Animations: Hover effects and transitions create a fluid and engaging user experience.
Professional Branding: The layout highlights Jason’s skills, projects, and contact details in a structured format.
LinkedIn Integration: A direct link to his LinkedIn profile is incorporated for networking opportunities.
